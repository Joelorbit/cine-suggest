# Design Engineering Review Checklist and Debugging

## Debugging Animations

### Slow motion testing

Play animations at reduced speed to spot issues invisible at full speed. Temporarily increase duration to 2-5x normal, or use browser DevTools animation inspector to slow playback.

Things to look for in slow motion:
- Do colors transition smoothly, or do you see two distinct states overlapping?
- Does the easing feel right, or does it start/stop abruptly?
- Is the transform-origin correct, or does the element scale from the wrong point?
- Are multiple animated properties (opacity, transform, color) in sync?

### Frame-by-frame inspection

Step through animations frame by frame in Chrome DevTools (Animations panel). This reveals timing issues between coordinated properties that you cannot see at full speed.

### Test on real devices

For touch interactions (drawers, swipe gestures), test on physical devices. Connect your phone via USB, visit your local dev server by IP address, and use Safari's remote devtools.

## Comprehensive Review Checklist

| Issue | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `transition: all` | Specify exact properties: `transition: transform 200ms ease-out` |
| `scale(0)` entry animation | Start from `scale(0.95)` with `opacity: 0` |
| `ease-in` on UI element | Switch to `ease-out` or custom curve |
| `transform-origin: center` on popover | Set to trigger location or use Base UI's `var(--transform-origin)` (modals are exempt — keep centered) |
| Animation on keyboard action | Remove animation entirely |
| Duration > 300ms on UI element | Reduce to 150-250ms |
| Hover animation without media query | Add `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` |
| Keyframes on rapidly-triggered element | Use CSS transitions for interruptibility |
| Framer Motion `x`/`y` props under load | Use `transform: "translateX()"` for hardware acceleration |
| Same enter/exit transition speed | Make exit faster than enter (e.g., enter 2s, exit 200ms) |
| Elements all appear at once | Add stagger delay (30-80ms between items) |
